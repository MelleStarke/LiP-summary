# 1. Introduction

## Basic Assumptions about Language

Basic assumptions:

- **Embodiedness**

  - "Language affected by and transmitted via *the body*"

    

  - The body is also used as a means of communication / the acquisition of ideas (e.g. prejudice)

  - our language is tied to our bodies

- **Embeddedness**

  - "Language affects and is affected by *social situations*"

- - brain’s evolution is co-determined by social developments

    

  - (communication always occurs in some context)

- **Mental Models**

  - "Humans *represent* the world *internally*"

- - includes perceptual, spatial, emotional, causal and temporal info

    

  - we produce language internally via mental models

  - mental model contains info about, e.g., how you feel about the situation, how it smells

  - it's your interpretation of the world as you experience it

- **Incremental Processing**

  - "Humans process language *over time* and *in parts*"

- - when analyzing messages, stores info is compared to the incoming signal (lexically, syntactically, semantically and world-knowledge-y) including emotion and motor aspects



## Language and Communication

**Communication:** *“Every action with which a person exchanges information (about needs, desires, perceptions, knowledge or affective states). Can be intentional or unintentional.”*

- No principled separation between language and other cognitive domains, since cognitive systems are modular (as can be seen in sign language).

*"the boundaries between different notions are a bit blurry"* - TD

communication as a transaction (creating meaning together): Certain vocabularies/dialects can create a group identity (e.g. hood-slang)



functions of communication:

1. info exchange
2. influencing others
3. developing relationships
4. fulfilling social obligations (saying "oh howdy neighbour how is your broken arm doing?" is expected of a person)
5. need
6. defining



the form of the message is an important co-determent of how much information and what information is transfered



medium is the massage: it's the way that people try to convey their message. Advertisements make everything seem amazing, and then show the product in the message

Trump has been using new mediums, like twitter, stock phrases(crooked hillary), lot of emotion in his messages. Although there is not much content, the medium is emphasised to such an extent that it influences the message a lot.

Technology affect the sensory balance. e.g. kids only watching youtube has less time to play outside with other kids. But it's also easy to be in your own echo chamber of ideas, influencing your perception of the world.



Language can be seen as a medium that extends human senses, in the sense of:

- **motor behaviour** (expressions can be seen as actions)
- **perception** (getting information from far away, e.g books)
- **emotion** (e.g. hearing a sad story makes you sad)
- **memory** (using language to record a memory)



two legs: just by being upright, you can see way farther and use your hands for things. Which may result in a stronger social cohesion



according to LUF: in language there are small units that are part of larger units that are part of even larger units

LUF doesn't have attention, cognitive control and monitoring

attention, cognitive control, monitoring and memory can go to non-linguistic processes. But representation, rules and processing components are purely linguistic, this part is generally what linguistics are interested in (i.e. the representation). Psychologists are more interested in processes

middle block is knowledge of the language 

the different machines (parts) process different, and increasingly higher level, language components

The reason that there's no arrows between machines is because the LUF allows feedback.

- signal recogniser: tries to represent the input in a faithful way so it can be processed
- word recogniser:
- sentence parser: represents (meaning of) sentence

information streams

- **autonomous** only bottom up (just a pipeline)
- **interactive** bottom up with a top-down effect of context on word recognition

*how strong is the effect of context on processing?* - TD. Big question in psycholinguistics

language processes:

- **automatic**: unconscious, does not disturb other processes. Handles information without you being aware how (e.g. walking)
- **controlled**: demand attention. conscious. voluntary. serial (doesn't occur simultaneously with other processes). eventually, they'll become automatic (usually. like driving)

linguistics would prefer to not use (un)consciousness in our models, since they'd prefer to explain everything via biological processes



segmentational ex: there is also "ten" in the signal, but the other segmentation makes more sense

sensory register = signal recogniser<br>short term store = working memory

according to chomsly: parts of language processing are like organs: you can look at them separately but they do interact



seeing a snake where there's a rope. Is this an interactive process or due to autonomous with incorrect stimuli? Are things sequential and modular, or are they interactive?

fodor: speech recogniser and print recogniser are *transducers*. A transducer's job is to represent input in a faithful way. The input is processed through a pipeline of autonomous modules. A central system (conceptual system in LUF) is an interactive system. Informationally encapsulated: recieves input and gives output, with the underlying process bot being affected by context. "function implemented in specific brain area" is naive. "characteristic problems in case of break-down (other modules will still work if one breaks down)" also incorrect, we have more or less dedicated machinery but they are affected by other components.

frying pan analogy: different sorts of information become available at different moments: first the shape, then colour, then its use, then related memories. This is because different brain areas retrieve information at different rates

# 2. Research Techniques

"off-line" means that they don't look at the processes, but look at how data is stored.

there are logical sequences in how people respond to stimuli.

measuring reaction time was the only reliable way for discovering mental processes, according to Donders

s8: "cat-dog" means cat is the prime, dog is the target



naming a word/picture involves retrieving phonological information and articulating it

re-naming a word (from one lang to another) is one of the most complex tasks we can do

[multilink.donders.ru.nl]()

**lexical decision with priming**:

- prime is cue
- prime is presented so quickly that you cannot actually read it (60 ms)

for the experiment where you read text in a sentence, there can be nonsense at one spot (e.g. x's) and when the participant regresses to read the word again, the computer can replace the nonsense by a real world, tricking the participant

in EEG, noise is practically random, therefore averaging helps

a disadvantage of ERP is that reaction times measure the end product of several processes, and don't say anything about them individually



ex. task demands: for lexical decision task we need to retrieve orthographic information
